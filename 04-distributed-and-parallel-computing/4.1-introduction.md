# Chapter 4: Distributed and Parallel Computing

## 4.1 Introduction

So far, we have focused on how to create, interpret, and execute programs. In Chapter 1, we learned to use functions as a means for combination and abstraction. Chapter 2 showed us how to represent data and manipulate it with data structures and objects, and introduced us to the concept of data abstraction. In Chapter 3, we learned how computer programs are interpreted and executed. The result is that we understand how to design programs for a single processor to run.

In this chapter, we turn to the problem of coordinating multiple computers and processors. First, we will look at distributed systems. These are interconnected groups of independent computers that need to communicate with each other to get a job done. They may need to coordinate to provide a service, share data, or even store data sets that are too large to fit on a single machine. We will look at different roles computers can play in distributed systems and learn about the kinds of information that computers need to exchange in order to work together.

Next, we will consider concurrent computation, also known as parallel computation. Concurrent computation is when a single program is executed by multiple processors with a shared memory, all working together in parallel in order to get work done faster. Concurrency introduces new challenges, and so we will develop new techniques to manage the complexity of concurrent programs.
